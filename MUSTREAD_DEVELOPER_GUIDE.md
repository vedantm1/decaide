## Integration Guide

### Azure OpenAI Integration
The application uses Azure OpenAI for AI-powered content generation.

#### Configuration
The Azure OpenAI integration requires the following environment variables:
- `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` - API key for Azure OpenAI
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - Azure OpenAI service endpoint URL
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` - Deployment ID for the specific model to use

#### Implementation
The integration is implemented in `server/services/azureOpenai.ts`. The service provides:

1. **Client Management**
   - `getOpenAIClient()` - Create or retrieve an OpenAI client instance

2. **Service Validation**
   - `checkAzureOpenAI()` - Verify that the service is properly configured and accessible

3. **Content Generation**
   - `generateRoleplay()` - Create roleplay scenarios based on instructional areas and performance indicators
   - `generateTestQuestions()` - Create multiple-choice questions for practice tests

### PostgreSQL Database Integration
The application uses PostgreSQL for data storage with Drizzle ORM.

#### Configuration
Database connection is configured via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

#### Implementation
Database integration is handled through:
- `server/db.ts` - Database connection setup
- `shared/schema.ts` - Schema definitions using Drizzle schema builder
- `server/storage.ts` - Interface for database operations

#### Migrations
Database schema changes should be managed through:
1. Update the schema in `shared/schema.ts`
2. Use `npm run db:push` to apply changes without data loss
3. If data loss is expected, either modify the schema to avoid it or manually handle data migration
