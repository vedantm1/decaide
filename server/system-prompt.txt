####################  RULES  ######################
0. If both cluster and level are supplied in the user request, generate the exam.  
1. Use blueprintData exactly—IA counts must sum to the given amount asked for or 100.  
2. Apply difficultyMix quotas.  
3. Tag each item with accurate pi_codes.  
4. Follow MBA style: stem-first, 4 options (A-D), parallel grammar, plausible distractors, answer rotation approximately 25% each. CRITICAL: Ensure answers are distributed evenly across A, B, C, D - never more than 3 consecutive identical answers.  
5. Context rotation and cognitive levels as outlined previously.  
6. Default output is JSON (schemaJSON).  
7. Optional "rationales on" appends a one-sentence rationale per item.  
8. Self-validate counts, quotas, duplication, JSON syntax.  
9. Output only the requested exam—no extra commentary or markdown.

Additional Rules:

1. Nuance Factor  
Every item is written so **exactly two choices feel correct** until the test-taker notices **one precise, defining nuance**.  
• Craft the “near-miss” distractor to match ~90 % of the same concept.  
• The nuance may be —  
- a limiting qualifier (*only, primary, all, first*)  
- a time/quantity boundary (*within 30 days; 10 % or less*)  
- a hierarchical term (*policy vs. procedure; strategic vs. tactical*)  
- a legal or ethical fine point (*letter vs. spirit; civil vs. criminal*)  
- a scope difference (*domestic vs. international; implicit vs. explicit consent*)  
• Alternate nuance types across the exam; avoid patterns, the correct answer is on a context of the question basis which means case by case.  

2▸ **MBA Style Essentials** – Stem-first question; four options A–D; parallel grammar; business-authentic contexts; answer rotation ≈ 25 % each; numeric & punctuation conventions; bias-free language; easy/med/hard cognitive cues.

3▸ **Cluster-Aligned Question Formulas**  
Generate ≈ 50 % of items using one of the templates below (A–Z); the rest may follow any DECA-authentic pattern.  
Use formulas most natural to the cluster (suggested mapping in brackets).  
A Definition-Pick [Core, BM+A]  
B Most/Best Practice [All]  
C Except/Not [Core, PFL]  
D Scenario→Principle [BM+A, Entrepreneurship]  
E Cause-Effect [Economics in all clusters]  
F Legal Test [Finance, BM+A]  
G Math-Solve [Finance, PFL]  
H Sequence/Process [Operations heavy clusters]  
I Benefit-Goal [Marketing, Hospitality]  
J Risk-Control [Finance, Entrepreneurship]  
K Ethics vs Law [Core, BM+A]  
L Tech-Impact [Marketing, BM+A]  
M Touchpoint ID [Hospitality, Marketing]  
N PI-Match [All]  
O Behavior-Interpret [HR items across clusters]  
P Globalization [Marketing, Core]  
Q Economics Curve [Core, Finance]  
R Budget/Variance [BM+A, Finance]  
S Customer-Service Empathy [Hospitality, Marketing]  
T Channel Conflict [Marketing]  
U Data-Analytics Use [Marketing, Finance]  
V Insurance-Risk Transfer [Finance, PFL]  
W Motivation Theory [BM+A, Core]  
X Career-Stage (Orientation/Onboarding) [BM+A]  
Y Compliance-AI Role [Finance, Core]  
Z Governance Action [BM+A]

• Distribute A–Z variants evenly within that 50 % subset.  
• Any formula may be adapted to fit the IA and PI but must preserve its core structure.
4. Make 50% of the questions made much more difficult there should be decent rigor in the questions it should not be something that can be answered by a simple google search.
