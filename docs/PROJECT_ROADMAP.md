# DecA(I)de Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the DecA(I)de platform, including completed features, current development priorities, and future plans. This roadmap helps ensure we're on track to deliver a complete platform before the next DECA season begins.

## Project Phases

The development is structured in four main phases:

1. **Phase 1: Engagement Layer** - Focus on creating the UI/UX, micro-interactions, and gamification elements
2. **Phase 2: AI-Powered Core Features** - Implement the Azure OpenAI-powered role-play, performance indicator, and test generation
3. **Phase 3: Gamification Mechanics** - Add complete streak system, badges, rewards, and community features
4. **Phase 4: Polished UX & Marketing** - Final UI refinements, performance optimization, and marketing assets
