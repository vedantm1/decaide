Thank you for providing that clear summary of the application. Based on your information, I'll help you run the web application locally.

Let me start the application using the npm run dev command:

Terminal
$ npm run dev
Let's check the output to see if the application is starting up:

Terminal
Read from Process
It seems there might be an issue with the package.json file. Let's check the available scripts:

Terminal
$ npm run
Let's check the output:

Terminal
Read from Process
Let's check if we're in the correct directory. Let's look at the package.json file again:

Terminal
$ type package.json
I can see that the package.json file has a "dev" script. Let's check if the server directory exists and what files it contains:

Terminal
$ dir server
Let's check if the server/index.ts file exists:

Read file
index.ts
server
Error
Ran into Cannot read file: server/index.ts while trying to read server/index.ts
Let's try using the launch-process to view the server/index.ts file:

Terminal
$ type server\index.ts
Now I understand the issue. Let's try running the application with the tsx command directly:

Terminal
$ npx tsx server/index.ts
Let's check the output:

Terminal
Read from Process
It seems there's an issue with the path. Let's try running it from the correct directory:

Terminal
$ cd C:\Users\phant\Downloads\DecAIde\DecAIde && npx tsx server/index.ts
Let's check the output:

Terminal
Read from Process
Let's try a different approach:

Terminal
$ cd C:\Users\phant\Downloads\DecAIde\DecAIde
Now let's try running the application:

Terminal
$ npx tsx server/index.ts
Let's check the output:

Terminal
Read from Process
Let's try a different approach. Let's check if there's a simpler way to run the application:

Terminal
$ node server/index.ts
Let's check the output:

Terminal
Read from Process
Let's try a different approach. Let's check if we can run the application using the npm start command:

Terminal
$ npm start
Let's check the output:

Terminal
Read from Process
