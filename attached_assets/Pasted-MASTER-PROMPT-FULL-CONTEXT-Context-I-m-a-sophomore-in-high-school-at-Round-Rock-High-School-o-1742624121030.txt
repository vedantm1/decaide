MASTER PROMPT (FULL CONTEXT)
Context:
I’m a sophomore in high school (at Round Rock High School, one of the largest DECA chapters worldwide).
I plan to launch an AI-Powered Learning Platform called DecA(I)de that initially focuses on DECA (Distributive Education Clubs of America) exam prep, roleplay prep, and written events. Later, it could expand to standardized tests like SAT, ACT, AP, etc.
The platform’s purpose is to standardize and streamline how students practice for DECA—especially roleplays, performance indicators (PIs), test questions, and other competition elements—by using AI to generate or optimize content.

1. Brand Name & Core Idea
Brand Name: DecA(I)de
Wordplay & Layered Meanings:
Dec-aide: Emphasizes it’s a dedicated tool to aid DECA participants.
Decade (I in parentheses): Removing “(I)” gives “Decade,” symbolizing longevity and consistency.
AI: Woven into the name, highlighting the artificial intelligence core.
The “I” for Individuality: Even though DECA events are often team-based, each person’s individuality matters.
Brand Slogan: “Who says there is no I in team?” – A playful take on the common phrase.

2. Logo & Symbolism
A Handshake: Symbolizes the professional aspect of DECA and business.
The handshake involves 10 fingers, referencing “DECA” (which is Greek for “ten”).
Hidden Letters: The shapes behind the handshake can be read as “AID” or “AI” plus a half circle, implying “AI as half the solution to your success.”

3. Initial Target Market & Expansion
Primary Focus: DECA members (high school students) who need help preparing for roleplay events, tests, performance indicators, and written events.
Immediate Launch: Plan to test and deploy at Round Rock High School (known for a massive DECA chapter).
Long-Term Vision: Expand from DECA to SAT, ACT, AP exams, or other competition-based organizations like FBLA, BPA, HOSA, etc.

4. Key Features / Functionality
Custom Roleplay Generation
Generate unlimited roleplay scenarios tailored to specific instructional areas (e.g., Marketing, Finance, Hospitality) or even specific performance indicators (PIs).
PI Explanations
Provide cohesive definitions of each performance indicator, with an option to customize to a user’s speaking style or event context.
Test Question Generation
Offer practice tests or question banks that mirror the style of official DECA exams.
Prop Generation
Ideas for visuals or small “props” to make a presentation stand out (like charts, simple prototypes, or talking points).
Example Paper & Dialogue Generation
For written events or roleplays, generate a sample “ideal paper” (outlining structure, key points, approximate writing speed) and an ideal judge-student dialogue.
Real-World Examples for PIs / Written Research
Provide relevant, practical examples that tie each performance indicator to real business scenarios.
Gamified Integration
Possibly add points, badges, or streaks for consistent practice to keep users motivated and “hooked.”
Targeted Practice
Focus on personal weak spots or commonly missed PIs/tests for each user.

5. Pricing Plans
Standard (⭐️⭐️) – $12.99/month
Basic set of roleplays (e.g., 1 scenario per instructional area, plus 5 test tries), plus fundamental PI explanations.
Plus (⭐️⭐️⭐️) – $19.99/month
Offers more roleplays, more test attempts, and possibly more in-depth customizations.
Pro (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️) – $39.99/month
Unlimited or advanced features (e.g., custom optimization, deeper analytics, more AI-driven dialogue practice).
Note: The “stars” (⭐️) in each plan are a subtle marketing/psychological trick – reminiscent of the “popcorn pricing” concept, where visual cues convey greater value.

6. Marketing & Scaling Plan
Initial Rollout at Round Rock HS
Use a Trial Basis: Offer ~500 licenses for the Standard plan to Round Rock students.
In return, get official or semi-official partnership so the chapter promotes DecA(I)de at every meeting, networking event, etc.
“If Vedant Doesn’t Make ICDC, Everyone Gets It Free”
Vedant (founder) competes in DECA. If he doesn’t qualify for the international competition (ICDC), the platform unlocks free (or discounted) access for a limited time.
Creates a Win-Win: If Vedant fails, the product is free → goodwill and viral buzz. If he succeeds, it proves the product works → brand credibility.
District → State
After seeing success at Round Rock, approach District 5 chapters, then move on to statewide adoption.
Leverage proven results/testimonials: “X% of DecA(I)de users advanced to State/ICDC.”
Word-of-Mouth & Social Media
Encourage students to share their experiences on TikTok, Instagram, or local DECA channels.
Potential for a referral program or “buddy system”: bring a friend, earn a discount or exclusive feature.
Long-Term Expansion
After capturing a large DECA audience, pivot or add modules for SAT/ACT/AP prep.
Potentially expand to other organizations (FBLA, BPA, HOSA, etc.)—still focusing on AI-driven, competition-style prep.

7. Execution Timeline & Goals
Product Fully Finished before the start of next DECA season (i.e., end of summer before junior year).
Technical Stack: Plan to use Azure for AI integration (have $150 in free credits). Possibly train or fine-tune an AI model with hundreds of sample roleplays, PI data, and sample test questions.
Addictive/Engaging UI: Aim for a TikTok-like effect or “video game” style engagement loop, without it being a literal game. Possibly incorporate daily challenges, achievements, or a progress tracker.
Collaborators:
Currently, it’s me (Vedant, strong in marketing) plus two friends with minimal coding knowledge.
Might need a designer with a “corporate Memphis” style or modern, minimal branding approach.

8. Additional Considerations / Notes
Legal/IP: Avoid directly copying copyrighted DECA roleplay prompts or test questions; focus on generating new, “similar-style” content.
Brand Identity: The handshake logo, the “I in team” slogan, and star-based pricing are key to creating a memorable identity.
Competition: Generic AI tools (like ChatGPT) exist, but DecA(I)de’s advantage is specialized content, curated references to PIs, a user-friendly interface, and a strong community tie (authentic DECA user base).
Immediate Goals:
Launch an MVP quickly (within weeks or a few months, not half a year).
Test with a small group at Round Rock.
Iterate fast, gather feedback, then do an official release when the DECA season starts ramping up.

9. What I Need from You (the “Other” AI)
Optimize this entire plan to the fullest.
Maximize success potential across every domain: marketing, product, AI implementation, partnerships, user engagement, pricing strategy, etc.
Propose any additional “genius-level” strategies to differentiate DecA(I)de in the market.
Refine the rollout timeline to achieve fast results (we don’t want to wait months if we can build an MVP quickly).
Ensure the final execution plan is as polished and strategic as possible, from technical details (Azure integration) to viral marketing (leveraging high-school hype, social media, the “If Vedant fails, it’s free” campaign).

How to Use This Master Prompt

Some notes for you to understand my vision:

I never want the user to directly interact with the AI, ever. The whole point is for it to be AI integrated, but not a rip off Chat gpt, the user should have zero awareness that they could just be doing it on some shitty ai platform, which they definitely could but our platform is tailored for deca as we are feeding it hundreds of documents. 

Here are some examples, for the questions when making them the user will have the option to choose the amount of questions or what questions to include or not include (There is an exam blueprint for every deca test so for example 15 economics questions, 7 business law, 23 emotional intellgeince) so they can choose, but at the end of the ai is integrated where it makes the questions on the spot but it becomes part of the platform not just a print of all the text. 

Another way would be with the roleplay, the user can choose the instructional area (ex. Is Finanical Analysis) and the PI’s in that instructional area but they cannot directly interact with the AI everything should be set 

For the PI explanations with real world examples, there should be a shit ton of preset options to help with what type of PI explanation they want, like 

For my standard and plus options, they will have a limited amount of generation capabitlies but they will be able to access the 10 standard given tests and roleplays for their events at any time (may lower it just a random number) as well as the standard PI explanations and a couple standard what your paper should look like. For Pro its unlimited in every aspect but we will find a way to limit it.


I want the site to extremely professional like the best possible, insane transitions animations, design and UX should be top notch, not some shitty project some high school kids put together like coproratoin level quality.

I want to make my system as least exploitable as possible and as addictive as possible. For example at the start when making the account or when handing out the licenses like I’m going to do at Roundrock since its one of the largest deca chapters in the world, I wil make it so at the start the user has to choose their event before proceeding so they only get the data sets for their event.

I want to make it as crazy as possible, like for example i want to make it where almost like duolingo or khan academy where is there some stimuli that goes off once you get soemtihng correct or not, like if a girl on a bike runs across the bottom of the screen whenever you get an option correct, maybe corporate memphis style. Point is i want something that keeps the user coming back so I want thousands of different little interactions like that integrated into the system, like probably hundreds of different random interactions when you get an answer wrong or right but not even that more than that. 

I want after every 25 min of work for their to be three or four options, it will say how it wants to emphasize how it doesnt want you to burnout and for your mental health, like hey youve been working hard, maybe its time to take a break in that break it will eitheir give an option to play a version of blockblast, a popular mobile game, play a random small minigame like another one, or even just a watch an eneteraining video or just a 5 minute timer, and at very end im good. This way the person gets addicted, and they have to spend 5 minutes extra each time. 

If there really needs to a thing to inquire about business questions and whatbnot, as that might be helpful since we are giving our competitors (google chat gpt other deca learning apps (only one out there that isnt great so not a big deal) some of our users time) i want it not be the stereotypical ai chatbot box, where you just type it in but somehow make a mascot the person talks to but different enough from just a chatbox, maybe the Diego the DecA(I)de Dolphin, where it just talks to this cartoon character that spits out text and maybe talks if needed to. 

Point is it should be a groundbreaking learning app that makes me millions in the future, and yo should maximize the chance of success
