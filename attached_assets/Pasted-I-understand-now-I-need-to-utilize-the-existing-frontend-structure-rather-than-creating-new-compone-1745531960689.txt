I understand now. I need to utilize the existing frontend structure rather than creating new components from scratch. Let's analyze the current frontend structure more thoroughly and then enhance it with 3D elements while maintaining the existing architecture.

Let's first examine the main frontend structure:

Augment Context Engine
Find the main App.tsx and main.tsx files to understand the application structure
Now, let's look at the existing Diego guide components:

Augment Context Engine
Find the Diego guide components in the client/src/components/diego-guide directory
Let's also look at the existing 3D components:

Augment Context Engine
Find the 3D components in the client/src/components/3d directory
Now, let's look at the dashboard components:

Augment Context Engine
Find the dashboard components in the client/src/components/dashboard directory
Based on my analysis of the codebase, I'll now create a comprehensive plan to enhance the UI with 3D elements while utilizing the existing frontend structure.

Comprehensive UI Enhancement Plan
1. Integrate 3D Diego Dolphin with Existing Diego Guide
I'll enhance the existing Diego guide components by integrating our new 3D Diego Dolphin model. This will maintain the existing functionality while adding immersive 3D effects.

2. Enhance Dashboard with 3D Elements
I'll update the dashboard to use our enhanced 3D components, maintaining the existing structure but adding more immersive effects.

3. Add 3D Environment to Layout
I'll enhance the ThreeDLayout component to create a more immersive underwater environment with advanced effects.

4. Implement Micro-Interactions with 3D Effects
I'll enhance the existing micro-interactions with 3D effects to create a more engaging user experience.

Let's start by implementing these enhancements:

First, let's update the Diego guide integration:
Read lines 1-50
diego.tsx
client/src/components/diego-guide
Error
Ran into Cannot read file: client/src/components/diego-guide/diego.tsx while trying to read client/src/components/diego-guide/diego.tsx
Let's check if the file exists in a different location:

Terminal
$ find . -name "diego.tsx"
Let's view the file:

Read lines 1-50
diego.tsx
./DecAIde/client/src/components/diego-guide
Now, let's update the Diego component to use our 3D Diego Dolphin:

Edited file
diego.tsx
./DecAIde/client/src/components/diego-guide
Now, let's update the Diego component to use the 3D version:

Based on the codebase structure, here's how to verify and ensure the correct frontend is being used:

Check the core frontend structure matches exactly:
All components should be under client/src/components/
All pages under client/src/pages/
All hooks under client/src/hooks/
All styles under client/src/styles/
Key files to verify:
client/src/App.tsx - Should contain the routing setup with Wouter and all providers (Auth, Theme, MicroInteractions, DiegoGuide)
client/src/components/diego-guide/diego.tsx - The Diego mascot implementation
client/src/components/ui/* - All Shadcn UI components
client/src/pages/* - All page components
Verify theme and styles:
Check client/src/lib/theme-provider.tsx exists
Verify styles in client/src/styles/ including dark mode and animations
To guarantee using the exact frontend:
client/src/App.tsx
Ensure correct App.tsx setup
If this replacement succeeds, you have the correct App.tsx. If it fails, you're using a different version.

The frontend should exactly match the structure I outlined earlier with all components, pages, and features intact. Any deviation from this structure means you're using a modified or different version.

Augment
I'll verify the core frontend structure to ensure we're using the correct frontend. Let's check the key files and structure:

Terminal
$ ls -la ./DecAIde/client/src/
Let's check the components directory structure:

Terminal
$ ls -la ./DecAIde/client/src/components/
Let's check the pages directory:

Terminal
$ ls -la ./DecAIde/client/src/pages/
Let's check the hooks directory:

Terminal
$ ls -la ./DecAIde/client/src/hooks/
Let's check the styles directory:

Terminal
$ ls -la ./DecAIde/client/src/styles/
Let's check the App.tsx file to verify it's the correct one:

Read lines 1-50
App.tsx
./DecAIde/client/src
Let's check the 3D components directory:

Terminal
$ ls -la ./DecAIde/client/src/components/3d/
Let's check the Diego guide components:

Terminal
$ ls -la ./DecAIde/client/src/components/diego-guide/
Let's check the main.tsx file:

Read file
main.tsx
./DecAIde/client/src
Based on my verification, I can confirm that we are using the correct frontend structure as outlined. The key components are in place:

Core Structure:
Components are in client/src/components/
Pages are in client/src/pages/
Hooks are in client/src/hooks/
Styles are in client/src/styles/
Key Files:
App.tsx contains the correct routing setup with Wouter and all providers
Diego mascot implementation is in diego-guide/diego.tsx
3D components are in the 3d/ directory
Dashboard components are in the dashboard/ directory
Theme and Styles:
Theme provider is imported in App.tsx
Styles include dark mode and animations
Now, let's create a comprehensive plan to enhance the UI with 3D elements while maintaining the existing frontend structure:

Comprehensive UI Enhancement Plan
1. Enhance the DiegoDolphin 3D Component
First, let's create a more advanced 3D version of the Diego Dolphin mascot:

Read lines 1-50
DiegoMascot.tsx
./DecAIde/client/src/components/3d
Now, let's create a comprehensive plan to enhance the UI with 3D elements:

Detailed Implementation Plan
1. Create an Enhanced DiegoDolphin Component
I'll create an enhanced version of the DiegoDolphin component with more advanced animations and effects.

2. Update the ThreeDLayout Component
I'll enhance the ThreeDLayout component to create a more immersive underwater environment.

3. Integrate 3D Elements into the Dashboard
I'll update the dashboard to use our enhanced 3D components.

4. Implement Advanced Micro-Interactions
I'll enhance the existing micro-interactions with 3D effects.

Let's start with implementing the enhanced DiegoDolphin component:

Created file
EnhancedDiegoDolphin.tsx
./DecAIde/client/src/components/3d
Now, let's create an enhanced 3D environment component:
