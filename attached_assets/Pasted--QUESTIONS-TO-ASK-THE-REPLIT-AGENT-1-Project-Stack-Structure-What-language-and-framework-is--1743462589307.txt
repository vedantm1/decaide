üß† QUESTIONS TO ASK THE REPLIT AGENT
üöß 1. Project Stack + Structure
What language and framework is my project built with? (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Node, etc.)

Is this project using a front-end framework like React or just vanilla HTML/CSS?

If it‚Äôs React, is it using Create React App, Next.js, Vite, or something else?

Does Replit support Tailwind CSS or Framer Motion for animations in this environment?

Where are my main files located (e.g., index.html, App.js, etc.)?

üß± 2. Exporting the Codebase
How can I export the entire codebase as-is and run it locally or on another host like Vercel?

Will the exported project work out of the box if I unzip it and run it with VS Code or GitHub + Vercel?

Does exporting include the Replit-specific files (.replit, replit.nix, etc.), and should I keep/remove them when hosting elsewhere?

üåê 3. Hosting + Deployment
Can I deploy this Replit project directly to Vercel, Netlify, or Azure Static Web Apps?

What setup steps would I need to take to get it live outside of Replit?

Will it support custom domains like decaide.org if deployed externally?

üß† 4. AI & Backend Integration Limits
Can this Replit project support calling Azure OpenAI APIs or Python-based Azure functions?

Can it integrate with Azure Cognitive Search or run Python scripts to do so?

Can Replit projects store and read large folders (like my scraped DECA folder) and use them for AI purposes?

Is it possible to build full-stack apps on Replit that involve Azure functions + frontend + backend?

‚öôÔ∏è 5. Version Control / Team Access
Can I add my team to this Replit project and give them code-level access?

If not, can I connect it to GitHub and have them work on it from there?

Is there a clean way to migrate this whole project to GitHub?

üé® 6. Animations / UI Enhancement Support
Can I use Framer Motion, GSAP, or advanced CSS animations in Replit?

Does Replit support canvas/webGL-level animation performance?

If not, would you recommend moving to Vercel + Next.js for that?
